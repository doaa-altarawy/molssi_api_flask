Werner and P. J. Knowles, and containing contributions from many other authors. It comprises efficient and well parallelized programs for standard  computational chemistry applications, such as DFT with a large choice of functionals, as well as state-of-the art high-level coupled-cluster and multi-reference wave function methods. Electronically  excited states can be treated using MCSCF\/CASSCF, CASPT2, MRCI, or FCI methods, or by response methods such as TDDFT, CC2, and EOM-CCSD. There are many modules for computing molecular properties, geometry optimization, calculation of harmonic and anharmonic vibrational frequencies, and further wave function analysis. \nAnalytical energy gradients are available for DFT, HF, MP2, CCSD, DCSD, QCISD, QCISD(T),  CASSCF, and CASPT2. Density fitting (DF or RI) approximations can speed up DFT and MP2 calculations with large basis sets by orders of magnitude, and explicitly correlated methods [MP2-F12, CCSD(T)-F12, CASPT2-F12, MRCI-F12] minimize basis set incompleteness errors to yield near CBS quality results with triple-zeta basis sets. Combined with local approximations and efficient parallelizations, high-level methods [LMP2-F12, LCCSD(T)-F12] can be be applied to large molecules of chemical interest, yielding unprecedented accuracy. \nFurthermore, WF-in-DFT embedding or QM\/MM methods can be used to extend the applicability of ab initio methods to large systems of chemical or biochemical interest.

For the ground-state, in contrast to classical computational molecular dynamics based on Newtonian mechanics, it uses the Car-Parrinello Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics (CPAIMD) and Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics (BOMD) approaches. Instead of using an empirical force function, the CPAIMD and BOMD algorithms compute the forces acting on each atom as the summation of multiple terms derived from plane-wave density functional theory. This allows OpenAtom to study complex atomic and electronic physics in semiconductor, metallic, biological and other molecular systems. For excited states, many-body perturbation theory methods are implemented to describe excited states from first principles. First, the \"GW\" approximation is implemented to provide accurate electronic energy bands and wave functions: this permits the description of individual electrons or holes in a material and how their properties are coupled and modified by interactions with the remaining electrons in the system. Second, in the near future, the \"Bethe-Salpeter Equation\" approach will be added to describe optically excited electronic states where both electrons and holes are present and interact.","comments":"Date is of latest Git commit","required_citation":null,"domain":"QM"},{"name":"OpenMX","owner":"TAB","license":"GPL","price":"free","latest_version":3.8,"date":"2016-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","official_website":"http:\/\/www.openmx-square.org\/","support_line":null,"documentation":"http:\/\/www.openmx-square.org\/openmx_man3.8\/openmx.html","tutorials":null,"wiki":null,"forum":"http:\/\/www.openmx-square.org\/forum\/patio.cgi","mail_list":null,"ui":null,"basis":"Plane-wave","semiempirical":null,"dft":"yes","dft_u":"yes","hybrid":null,"rohf":null,"uhf":null,"mcscf":null,"ci":null,"mp_or_mbpt":null,"cc":null,"rpa":null,"gf":"yes","tddft":null,"dmf":null,"coverage":"H..Rn","fequencies_phonons":null,"nmr":null,"other":null,"symmetry":null,"parallel":"hybrid OpenMP\/MPI","gpu":null,"knl":null,"source":"http:\/\/www.openmx-square.org\/download.html","executables":null,"code_management":null,"continuous_integration":null,"tests":66,"languages":["C"],"compilers":null,"description":"OpenMX (Open source package for Material eXplorer) is a software package for\n   nano-scale material simulations based on density functional theories (DFT),\n   norm-conserving pseudopotentials, and pseudo-atomic\n   localized basis functions.","long_description":"OpenMX (Open source package for Material eXplorer) is a software package for nano-scale material simulations based on density functional theories (DFT) [1], norm-conserving pseudopotentials [21,22,23,24,25], and pseudo-atomic localized basis functions [30]. The methods and algorithms used in OpenMX and their implementation are carefully designed for the realization of large-scale ab initio electronic structure calculations on parallel computers based on the MPI or MPI\/OpenMP hybrid parallelism. The efficient implementation of DFT enables us to investigate electronic, magnetic, and geometrical structures of a wide variety of materials such as biological molecules, carbon-based materials, magnetic materials, and nanoscale conductors. Systems consisting of 1000 atoms can be treated using the conventional diagonalization method if several hundreds cores on a parallel computer are used. Even ab initio electronic structure calculations for systems consisting of more than 10000 atoms are possible with the O(N) method implemented in OpenMX if several thousands cores on a parallel computer are available. Since optimized pseudopotentials and basis functions, which are well tested, are provided for many elements, users may be able to quickly start own calculations without preparing those data by themselves. Considerable functionalities have been implemented for calculations of physical properties such as magnetic, dielectric, and electric transport properties. Thus, we expect that OpenMX can be a useful and powerful theoretical tool for nano-scale material sciences, leading to better and deeper understanding of complicated and useful materials based on quantum mechanics.
